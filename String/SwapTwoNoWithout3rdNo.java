//2. How do you swap two numbers without using a third variable in Java?
//Swapping numbers without using a third variable is a three-step process thatâ€™s better visualized in code:
//
//b = b + a; // now b is sum of both the numbers
//a = b - a; // b - a = (b + a) - a = b (a is swapped)
//b = b - a; // (b + a) - b = a (b is swapped)

public class SwapTwoNoWithout3rdNo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = 10;
		int b = 20;
		System.out.println("a is "+a+" b is  "+b);
		
		a=a+b;
		b=a-b;
		a=a-b;
		System.out.println("a is "+a+" b is  "+b);
